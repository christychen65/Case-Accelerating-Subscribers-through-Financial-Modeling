### 1. Introduction
In August 2020, following the release of Q2 industry results, the President of Mobility has requested an evaluation of strategies to accelerate prepaid gross subscriber additions. The following analysis will develop a comprehensive business case for a telecommunications company that includes a 3-year monthly discounted cash flow and a presentation to the President of Mobility.

### 2. Obejective
The objective of the given scenario is to evaluate and determine the best strategic decision for this telecommunications company to accelerate prepaid gross subscriber additions. The goal is to analyze two options: partnering with a leading retail chain or building its own stores directly. Through a comprehensive business case, including a 3-year monthly discounted cash flow analysis and a presentation to the President of Mobility, the objective is to provide a recommendation based on rationale, assumptions, and considerations of opportunities and risks in the marketplace. <br />
<br />
In the following analysis, We will explain the reasoning behind our conclusions and outline any assumptions made. To support our assumptions, we also utilized publicly available information, such as quarterly earnings reports and news releases from various carriers. 

### 3. Data
* The primary focus revolves around two options: partnering with a leading retail chain consisting of approximately 2,000 locations, or directly building Bell stores. However, due to capacity and resource limitations, Mobility can only deploy a maximum of 1,500 stores over an 8-month period. It is anticipated that building its own stores would be more efficient, with an estimated monthly sales volume of 50 units per store compared to approximately 38 units at partner locations. Nevertheless, the prepaid market's unpredictable nature introduces variability of up to 10 units in these estimates. <br />
<br />

* Considering the scale of the partner, they have requested a specialized compensation package, including a $95 commission per sale and a 20% share of revenue generated. In contrast, this telecommunications company plans to offer lower internal commissions ($10), but would incur annual salaries and benefits totaling $30,000. Rent for each store location is estimated to average $40,000, with an additional cost of $10,000 per store for fixtures.<br />
<br />

* We also got the following information / KPIs from the Analytics team:

<br />
